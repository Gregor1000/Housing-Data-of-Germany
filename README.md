# Phyton, Tableau
The data analyst course at CareerFoundry was project-based. For my last project I chose my own dataset and finished the project with Python and Tableau:
# Housing Data of Germany from [Immobilienscout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/)
All python coding can be found in the Scripts folder
# Objective
Prepare and analyse the dataset as needed and derive insights
# Data
Scrapped data from www.immobilienscout24.de via www.kaggle.com on the date 14.7.2020.
# Presentation of findings
I presented the results via a [Tableau-Story-Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gregor.liftinger/viz/GermanHousingMarket/Story1)
